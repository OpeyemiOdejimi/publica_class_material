      "Query: What is VPC peering?\n",
      "Response: VPC peering is a networking connection between two Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) networks that allows them to communicate with each other as if they were part of the same network. This connection enables resources in different VPCs to interact privately and securely without requiring public IP addresses or traversing the public internet. Here are the key aspects of VPC peering:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Direct Communication**: VPC peering allows instances in one VPC to communicate with instances in another VPC using private IP addresses. This direct communication enhances security and reduces latency.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **No Transitive Peering**: VPC peering is non-transitive, meaning that if VPC A is peered with VPC B, and VPC B is peered with VPC C, instances in VPC A cannot communicate directly with instances in VPC C through VPC B. Each peering connection must be established individually.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Same or Different Regions**: VPC peering can be established between VPCs in the same region or across different regions (inter-region peering), allowing for flexible network architectures.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Resource Sharing**: VPC peering enables organizations to share resources across different VPCs, such as databases, applications, or services, without exposing them to the public internet.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Security and Access Control**: VPC peering does not automatically grant access to resources. Network access control lists (ACLs) and firewall rules must be configured to allow traffic between the peered VPCs.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Use Cases**:\n",
      "   - **Multi-Project Architecture**: Organizations can use VPC peering to connect VPCs across different projects, enabling resource sharing and collaboration.\n",
      "   - **Microservices Communication**: In a microservices architecture, different services can be deployed in separate VPCs and communicate securely through peering.\n",
      "   - **Hybrid Cloud Solutions**: VPC peering can facilitate communication between on-premises networks and cloud resources by connecting multiple VPCs.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Cost**: While there are no additional charges for establishing a VPC peering connection, data transfer costs may apply for traffic flowing between the peered VPCs, depending on the cloud provider's pricing model.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. **Limitations**: There are some limitations to VPC peering, such as the maximum number of active peering connections allowed per VPC and the need for careful management of IP address ranges to avoid conflicts.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, VPC peering is a powerful feature that enables secure and efficient communication between VPCs, making it a valuable tool for organizations looking to build scalable and interconnected cloud architectures.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Query: Explain subnetting in Google Cloud Networking\n",
      "Response: Subnetting in Google Cloud Networking involves dividing a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) network into smaller, manageable segments called subnets. Each subnet can be used to organize resources, control traffic, and enhance security within the VPC. Here are the key aspects of subnetting in Google Cloud:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **CIDR Notation**: Subnets are defined using Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) notation, which specifies the IP address range for the subnet. For example, a subnet defined as `10.0.0.0/24` has an IP address range from `10.0.0.0` to `10.0.0.255`.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Regional Subnets**: In Google Cloud, subnets are regional resources, meaning they exist within a specific region. Each subnet can span multiple zones within that region, allowing for high availability and redundancy.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **IP Address Allocation**: When you create a subnet, you must specify a range of IP addresses. Google Cloud automatically allocates IP addresses from this range to resources (like VM instances) that are created within the subnet.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Custom and Automatic Subnets**:\n",
      "   - **Custom Subnets**: You define the IP ranges and create subnets according to your needs. This allows for more control over the network architecture.\n",
      "   - **Automatic Subnets**: Google Cloud can automatically create subnets in each region with predefined IP ranges when you create a VPC network.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Firewall Rules**: Subnets can have associated firewall rules that control the traffic to and from the resources within the subnet. This allows you to enforce security policies at the subnet level.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Routing**: Each subnet is associated with a routing table that determines how traffic is directed within the VPC and to external networks. Google Cloud automatically creates routes for subnets, but you can also define custom routes.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Peering and Shared VPC**: Subnets can be shared across different projects using Shared VPC, allowing for centralized management of network resources while enabling different teams or projects to use the same network infrastructure.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. **Best Practices**: When designing subnets, consider factors such as IP address utilization, future growth, and security requirements. It's often recommended to leave some IP address space for future expansion.\n",
      "\n",
      "By effectively using subnetting in Google Cloud, you can create a well-organized and secure network architecture that meets the needs of your applications and services.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Query: What is Network endpoint groups(NEG)\n",
      "Response: Network Endpoint Groups (NEGs) in Google Cloud are a way to manage and route traffic to specific endpoints, such as virtual machine (VM) instances, containers, or even external services. NEGs provide a flexible and efficient way to define how traffic is directed to your applications, especially in scenarios involving microservices or containerized applications. Here are the key features and characteristics of Network Endpoint Groups:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Endpoint Management**: NEGs allow you to define a group of endpoints that can be used as backends for load balancers. Each endpoint can be a VM instance, a specific IP address, or a service running in a Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) cluster.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Types of NEGs**:\n",
      "   - **Zonal NEGs**: These are associated with a specific zone and can include VM instances or IP addresses within that zone.\n",
      "   - **Serverless NEGs**: These are used to route traffic to serverless applications, such as Cloud Run services or App Engine applications.\n",
      "   - **Internet NEGs**: These allow you to route traffic to external endpoints that are not hosted within Google Cloud.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Load Balancing**: NEGs can be used as backends for various types of load balancers in Google Cloud, including HTTP(S) load balancers, TCP/UDP load balancers, and internal load balancers. This enables efficient traffic distribution across multiple endpoints.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Health Checks**: Google Cloud can perform health checks on the endpoints defined in a NEG to ensure that traffic is only routed to healthy instances. If an endpoint fails a health check, it will be temporarily removed from the load balancer's backend pool.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Dynamic Scaling**: NEGs support dynamic scaling of endpoints, allowing you to add or remove endpoints as needed without disrupting traffic flow. This is particularly useful in microservices architectures where services may scale up or down based on demand.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Integration with Kubernetes**: NEGs can be used with Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) to manage traffic to Kubernetes services. This allows for seamless integration between Kubernetes workloads and Google Cloud's load balancing capabilities.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Granular Traffic Control**: By using NEGs, you can implement more granular traffic control and routing policies, allowing you to direct traffic based on specific criteria, such as URL paths or request headers.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. **Use Cases**: NEGs are particularly useful in scenarios such as:\n",
      "   - Microservices architectures where different services need to be accessed independently.\n",
      "   - Load balancing traffic to containerized applications running in GKE.\n",

      "Query: What are IAM roles in Google Cloud?\n",
      "Response: IAM (Identity and Access Management) roles in Google Cloud are a way to manage permissions for users, groups, and service accounts. They define what actions can be performed on specific resources within Google Cloud. Here are the key aspects of IAM roles:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Role Types**:\n",
      "   - **Basic Roles**: These are predefined roles that provide broad access to Google Cloud resources. They include:\n",
      "     - **Owner**: Full control over all resources, including the ability to manage roles and permissions.\n",
      "     - **Editor**: Can modify all resources but cannot manage roles and permissions.\n",
      "     - **Viewer**: Read-only access to all resources.\n",
      "\n",
      "   - **Predefined Roles**: These roles are more granular and are designed for specific services. For example, a predefined role for Compute Engine might allow users to start and stop virtual machine instances without granting full access to all resources.\n",
      "\n",
      "   - **Custom Roles**: You can create custom roles that include specific permissions tailored to your organization's needs. This allows for fine-grained access control.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Permissions**: Each role consists of a set of permissions that define what actions can be performed. For example, the permission `compute.instances.start` allows a user to start a virtual machine instance.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Role Assignment**: Roles are assigned to users, groups, or service accounts at different levels, including:\n",
      "   - **Project Level**: Roles can be assigned to resources within a specific project.\n",
      "   - **Folder Level**: Roles can be assigned to all projects within a folder.\n",
      "   - **Organization Level**: Roles can be assigned to all resources within an organization.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Principle of Least Privilege**: It's a best practice to assign the minimum necessary permissions to users and service accounts. This reduces the risk of unauthorized access and potential security breaches.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **IAM Policies**: IAM roles are part of IAM policies, which define who (identity) has what access (roles) to which resources (scope). Policies can be managed through the Google Cloud Console, gcloud command-line tool, or REST API.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Audit Logging**: Google Cloud provides audit logs that track changes to IAM policies and role assignments, helping organizations monitor access and ensure compliance.\n",

    "\n",
    "The agentic RAG system combines a Chroma vector store, OpenAI embeddings, and a retrieval tool decorated with @tool. Testing showed that domain-specific queries, like \"Explain subnetting in Google Cloud,\" correctly triggered retrieval and returned relevant document chunks. General knowledge questions, such as \"What is Python?\" were answered directly without retrieval. Multi-turn conversations also worked correctly, as the MemorySaver preserved context, allowing coherent follow-ups.\n",
    "\n",
    "**System Performance**\n",
    "\n",
    "The system performed well: document loading, chunking, embedding, and vectorization were smooth; the agent made appropriate retrieval decisions; and memory successfully preserved context. Areas for improvement include optimizing retrieval relevance through alternative chunk sizes or reranking strategies, and improving speed by considering local embedding models to reduce dependency on OpenAI API calls.\n",
